I obtained my PhD in Economics from Durham University in 2024, specialising in applied econometrics, labour economics, behavioural economics, and sports economics. I empirically analyse data from sport competitions to understand human behaviour under specific conditions.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Hospitality Coordinator at UEFA.
